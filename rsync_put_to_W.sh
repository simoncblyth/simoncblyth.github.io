rsync_put_to_W.sh
===================

This is a workaround for github/bitbucket blockage.
It is not convenient to get around that blockage
on machines I do not control such as W.
So rsync_put_to_W.sh rsyncs from A to W.


HMM : how dodgy a thing is this ?
------------------------------------

* as the target machine is for presentation of html its
  probably no big deal, however note that if use
  git on the remote side it means a git binary version 
  is having to deal with the raw repo files provide by 
  another git version


rsync options
----------------

-z, --compress   compress file data during the transfer
-a, --archive    archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)
-r, --recursive  recurse into directories
-v, --verbose    increase verbosity
    --delete     delete extraneous files from dest dirs

* :google:`rsync git repository`

* https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2020/09/22/migrating-git-data-with-rsync/

::

    "The moral of the story here is to never omit --delete from rsync if youâ€™re
    trying to keep repos in sync."


git bundle
-----------

Another approach see "git help bundle"


observations
----------------

* Doing almost nothing sync takes about 20s
* use of "--delete" is a bit fraught, so this script
  is deliberately not very flexible to avoid surprises
