Hepex Document Building

Current GNUMakefile
--------------------


Current make commands, omit the special sauce that creates a crisper **screen** (as opposed to **printed**) pdf::

        simon:EndOfYear11 blyth$ make -n
        echo Remaking EndOfYear11.dvi
        latex EndOfYear11
        bibtex EndOfYear11 
        ./fix_bbl < EndOfYear11.bbl > EndOfYear11.bbl.fixed; mv EndOfYear11.bbl{.fixed,}
        latex EndOfYear11
        latex EndOfYear11
        echo Remaking EndOfYear11.ps
        dvips -o EndOfYear11.ps EndOfYear11.dvi 
        simon:EndOfYear11 blyth$ 


Build ps and create pdf with::

       simon:EndOfYear11 blyth$ make
       simon:EndOfYear11 blyth$ ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -dMaxSubsetPct=100 -dCompatibilityLevel=1.2 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true EndOfYear11.ps
       simon:EndOfYear11 blyth$ du -hs *.pdf
       4.4M    EndOfYear11.pdf



failure with older latex (cms01)

link check
-----------

b2c tables 

#. cyan link boxes are suitably eliminated for b2c tables 

#. links still work OSX Leopard Preview.app

     #. cursor changes to gloved hand and hover message provides the URL, **must keep cursor still for a second or so** 

#. links after b2c section in the references look standard and work, charmless url is simply a tt, not using hyperref package

::

    the rare web page: {\tt http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/hfag/rare/index.html}.



quality
--------

#. ps2pdf .pdf looks blurry on OSX Leopard in Preview.app 

   #. horrendous quality without anti-aliasing 
   #. OK but a bit blurry with anti-aliasing 
   #. pixelation apparent even with moderate zooming (curiously math is using scalable fonts but text is bitmapped)
   #. compare with b2c section alone, that uses scalable fonts for text and math


#. Decay angle Figure ~63, ~p228 the planes have psychedelic colors (doing gradients is ambitious)

secret sauce
-------------

Even with secret sauce still getting blurry pdf.

::

        $(NAME).pdf : $(NAME).ps
                ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -dMaxSubsetPct=100 -dCompatibilityLevel=1.2 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true $(NAME).ps

        $(NAME).ps: $(NAME).dvi
                dvips -z -Ppdf -G0 $(NAME).dvi -o $(NAME).ps 
                # suspect that only -Ppdf is important to creating goodquality pdf nowadays

::

  -z     Pass html hyperdvi specials through to the output for eventual distillation into PDF.  
         This is not enabled by default to avoid including the header files unnecessarily, and use of temporary files in
         creating the output.

  -P printername
          Sets up the output for the appropriate printer.  
          This is implemented by reading in config.printername , which can then set the output pipe 
          (as in, !lpr -Pprintername as well as the  font  paths  and
          any  other  config.ps  defaults for that printer only.  
          Note that config.ps is read before config.printername 
          In addition, another file called ~/.dvipsrc is searched for immediately after config.ps;
          this file is intended for user defaults.  
          If no -P command is given, the environment variable PRINTER is checked.  
          If that variable exists, and a corresponding configuration file exists,  
          that  configuration file is read in.

    -G     Causes dvips to shift non-printing characters to higher-numbered positions.  This may be useful sometimes.



simpler approach
-----------------


Looks just as grotty::

    simon:EndOfYear11 blyth$ PRINTER=pdf make pdf    ## 4.4 MB pdf

Add some sauce, hmm but still just as blurry::

    simon:EndOfYear11 blyth$ ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -dMaxSubsetPct=100 -dCompatibilityLevel=1.2 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true EndOfYear11.ps

Back to dvi::

    NAME=EndOfYear11

Hmm still blurry.

Suggestion that blurryness is due to bitmap fonts, that can be remedied using scalable fonts

compare preambles between b2c alone and full hepex
----------------------------------------------------

Commenting the line, gets to scalable everywhere::
   
   \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

Alternatives to this involve moving to a newer tex distribution or installing fonts.
