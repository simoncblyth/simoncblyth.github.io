Blurb Editing
==============

We have few enough members that all are welcome and encouraged to
add/improve the blurb latex. As it is managed in SVN we can always
revert if others disagree with changes made.

The blurb.tex is accessible in SVN at

 * http://dayabay.phys.ntu.edu.tw/tracs/heprez/browser/trunk/compilation
 * http://dayabay.phys.ntu.edu.tw/repos/heprez/trunk/compilation

Check out that directory, edit and commit::

     svn co http://dayabay.phys.ntu.edu.tw/repos/heprez/trunk/compilation/
     vi compilation/blurb.tex
     svn ci compilation -m "brief informative message"

If you plan to make extensive changes you should perhaps
organize a top level blurb that includes other sections.
