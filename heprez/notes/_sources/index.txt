Heprez Development Log
=======================

:Version: |version|
:Date: |today|

Objectives for these pages.

#. :doc:`SOP` document with task based entry point to referencing Trac tickets/wikipages/changesets 
#. :doc:`TODO` list  
#. :doc:`log/end_of_2011` log of activities, especially scrape campaigns

Major issues should continue to be tracked via heprez trac tickets 
but often a large number of smaller issues are dealt with when performing scrapes.  
The Trac interface is suited to long lived issues, whereas a more logging style of
interface is useful to capture operational fixes and techniques.

Rationale for this Documentation
=================================

Have formerly been using Trac wiki pages for documentation purpose, 
but that looses the intimate context of having documentation sources 
residing in the same repository as the code being developed, 
and suffers from inconvenient web interface text editing.

Seeing **TODO** items and logged fixes in the same commits as the 
code changes is invaluable. **Also documentation remains visible from 
sources during downtime of server database**.

Very structured information closely linked to bash functions should be logged
within the bash functions themselves. For example:

#. scrape running times in :trunk:`scrape/scrape.bash`
#. backup log purposes :trunk:`backup/backup.bash`

Updating these pages
---------------------

Sphinx is run on G and the generated html is rsynced across to server, do that from G with::

   cd ~/h
   make
