Server Migration
=================

Historical Layout
------------------

`hfag.phys.ntu.edu.tw`
            **presentation** apache providing result presentation, currently simple URL rewriting via apache config only, nothing dynamic
            this "public face"  should be the last to move
`cms01.phys.ntu.edu.tw`
            **edit** machine providing rezdb interface, needs java/tomcat/chiba/exist
`laptop`
            **scrape** machine propagates from `cms01` and transfers results to `hfag`  
`dayabay.phys.ntu.edu.tw`
            **repo** Trac/SVN server holding heprez and env repositories, perhaps migrate to bitbucket/github 


Future Layout
--------------

#. Consolidating **edit** and **scrape** onto one server straightforward


`b2mc.kek.jp` 
            replaces `laptop` and could replace `cms01` for editing too


Accessibility of b2mc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

b2mc is now able to provide the rezdb editing  service but using it currently requires ssh access 
and tricky config to route http via a socks proxy.

Repo hosting

Migrate from svn to git/hg for much wider choice of hosting.
