INTEGRATION

AFS access

* try regain AFS via IHEP : sent to maqm 
* try regain AFS via SLAC : sent to Tim

Mars has AFS

URGENT DEVELOPMENT
===================

decouple fast from slow scraping
----------------------------------

Decouple fast text html,tex,svg pulling out of queries from slow conversions to pdf,jpg,png 

    #. skip jpg rendition of the PDF compilation 
    #. skip all binary conversions on query pass, do these (or omit where possible) in separate pass
    #. combination page latex is not useful without flattening : so skip and just retain PDF link ? 
    #. exist console full of convert errors failing to create jpg from ps :heprez:`ticket:177`


NON URGENT DEVELOPMENT 
========================

enhancements
-------------

#. more prominent link to http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/hfag/

#. find home for reference links such as http://www.xquery.co.uk/tutorial_xquery_get_started/get_tutorial_page/xquery_global_variables

#. fix rezdb previews for multi factor qwn (maybe with MathJax)

#. investigate clientside javascript possibilities : MathJax and JSXChart 

#. cache kicks in only on 3rd pass :ticket:`178`

#. suppress non-contributors in tables (and plots?)

#. automated charge conservation checking ? can the charge be systematically be determined from PDG code without too much pain ? or is that in pdg.xml ?

#. factor out latex2html conversions in the automated workflow, this was manually done post v007 ``end_of_2011`` 

   #. primary issue is if the metrics from the latex2html conversion are still needed ?

.. digraph:: foo

   "tex" -> "pdf";
   "tex" -> "png" [label=latex2html, color=red] ;
   "pdf" -> "svg";
   "svg" -> "opdf";
   "svg" -> "opng" [label=illustrator, color=green] ;

#. longer term want to move away from commercial illustrator (eg to inkscape)

#. Trac RST previews fail to handle the Sphinx toctree directive, eg 

   * some Trac config switch to get rid of RST previewing ?
   * http://dayabay.phys.ntu.edu.tw/tracs/heprez/browser/trunk/qxml/index.rst
   * http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/9915  takes approach of making error messages less objectionable, 
   * I would prefer presentation of source RST as plain text, without renaming all .rst to .txt


recursion inversion
--------------------

#. current hidden approach : inflexible, difficult to optimize, difficult error handling 

#. do recursion at top level : quickly yield combination html (hmm maybe move to xhtml to avoid having to have xml fragments + final html) then recurse over links within that and so on 

#. this differs from current arrangement where it the comb page waits on it dependents 

#. compilation latex relies on having run scape and created already all the .tex : somewhat wrong ordering for setting shrinkages


qxml : dbxml based alternative to eXist
-----------------------------------------

#. qxml : make which maps to load cli controllable

#. exist2qxml.py : shakedown selective running, maybe getting interference with map loading ?

#. exist2qxml.py : metadata checking, seeing some suprising timestamps reported, in the ballpark but hours off 

#. look into qxml scrape based off transfered /db/hfagc_prod into avg.dbxml : ie retain exist avg but try to benefit from qxml speed for the scrape  

#. mode presentation uses the product particle ordering from the first corresponding mode with the qtag 

   #. this is not reproducible in dbxml due to node ordering differneces (eg 9 qtags in qtag2xml have different presentation)
   #. this technique is liberally sprinkled, not so easy to change even if an approach can be identified 

#. xquery module renaming and reorganisation, rezu rezt rezx meanings have been lost due to difficult exist development environment


misc
------

* DONE : ``exist-up-hfagc`` warns ``WILL NEED exist-place-xsl`` but ``exist-place-xsl`` sees nothing to do, change it to be based on diffs :r:`776`

* DONE : hfag, suspect that a reboot will lead to the wrong apache getting started .. cleaned up init.d

* DONE : table 72, overlap  http://hfag.phys.ntu.edu.tw/b2charm/00109.html
* DONE : missing key table : suspect r759 the 99999 collection not created 
* DONE : broken table link in key caption due to incorrect hardcoded last table following classification change::

    * ``table.xq`` is source for the key caption, changed::
         \ref{tab:hfc03300} to \ref{tab:hfc04300}

* DONE : Yasmine in the : "who we are"

within 00104, one LHCb result appears twice (FIXED)

**pig-in-poke** issue, implicated with qwn mis-classification
---------------------------------------------------------------

:cms01:`b2charm/end_of_2011/00108.html`  :heprez:`ticket:171`

  * also range based plot splitting involved
  * DONE : belle result mis-classification implicated, so get that fixed before investigating further
  * DONE : fixed up error SVG to avoid remedial ``simon:20120417 blyth$ mv ./hfagc/00108/01128/01128.svg ./hfagc/00108/01128/01128.svg.dud``
  * :cms01:`b2charm/end_of_2011/01128.svg`

SUPERCEEDED SINGLE REZ VISIBLE (FIXED v006)
--------------------------------------------

Superceeded results should be visible, only "inactive" are hidden, 

* http://cms01.phys.ntu.edu.tw/b2charm/0905018.html

* ``rez.xq`` invokes ``rezt:present-rez``, include superceeded in :r:`775`

::

   echo "distinct-values(collection('rem')//rez:status)" | qxml -

   active
   inactive
   superceeded
