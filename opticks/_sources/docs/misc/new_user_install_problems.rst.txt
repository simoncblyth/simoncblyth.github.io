Hi, 

Instructions for installing Opticks are linked below, you should be following them:

* https://simoncblyth.bitbucket.io/opticks/docs/opticks.html
* https://simoncblyth.bitbucket.io/opticks/docs/install.html

NB make sure that you are using the latest opticks from bitbucket, 
NOT the old release from GitHub.

Some of the errors you got makes me suspect that you are using 
the old version from GitHub.

You should be using:

* https://bitbucket.org/simoncblyth/opticks

You can check if you cloned the correct one with “git remote -v”::

    epsilon:opticks blyth$ cd ~/opticks
    epsilon:opticks blyth$ git remote -v 
    origin	git@bitbucket.org:simoncblyth/opticks.git (fetch)
    origin	git@bitbucket.org:simoncblyth/opticks.git (push)
    epsilon:opticks blyth$
