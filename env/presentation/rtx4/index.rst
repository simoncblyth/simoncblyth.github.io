One of the standout features of the Blackwell architecture is the integration
of GDDR7 memory, which sets a new industry standard. Developed by multiple
vendors, GDDR7 memory offers significant improvements over its predecessor,
GDDR6. It is not only twice as fast as GDDR6, but it also consumes half the
power per bit of data transferred.

The biggest change is the signaling technology. GDDR6X uses PAM4 signaling,
which relies on four levels of logic to sample the clock. This design allows
for a certain width of the "data eye," which refers to the amount of noise
immunity in the signal. The larger the data eye, the cleaner and faster the
data can be transferred.

GDDR7 moves to PAM3 signaling, which uses three levels of logic instead of
four. This shift results in a larger data eye, allowing for higher frequencies
and better performance. PAM3 can run at higher speed than PAM4, which means it
will transmit more data per second, despite transferring less data per clock
cycle.
