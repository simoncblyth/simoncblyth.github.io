    Dear Weidong, 

    Yes, I can give an overview of applying GPU ray tracing techniques
    to optical photon simulation.  

    https://simoncblyth.bitbucket.io/env/presentation/opticks_aug2020_sjtu_neutrino_telescope_workshop.html

    The above talk from the SJTU neutrino telescope workshop in 2020 is the last overview style talk 
    I gave which does not assume any familiarity with Opticks. So I expect to start from that 
    presentation to prepare for the Hong Kong meeting.

    The SJTU presentation was more than an hour, but the end of it is speculation on 
    future usage for enormous numbers of photons in neutrino telescopes.
     
    I would prefer not to give such a long talk as it takes longer to prepare.  
    It would be fine to trim the speculations and update for OptiX 7 development 
    and cut it down to 20-30 min.

    Simon

    Dear Simon,
    Do you think you can give an overview  talk on application of Optix in HEP
    at the Hong Kong meeting? The meeting should be around 15th of January.
    Look forward to hearing from you!

    主题: Hong Kong Workshop

    Dear Weidong,

    Thanks for agreeing to help me organize the workshop in Hong Kong.
    As we discussed the topic is: "Innovation in HEP Detectors and Computing"
    We will focus on innovative ideas that can bring significant improvements to
    the field.
    There can be a range of ideas with different degrees of innovation, but the
    goal is to aim at more disruptive technologies, like Quantum computing, and
    then fill come down from there.

    We will want to invite both foreigners and chinese speakers, but we should
    try to aim at good speakers that can provide a good overview of the subject.
    I attached the timetable. The workshop will have two days, and we should try
    to split it with one day for detector and another day for
    computing/software.
    There are 4 periods each day with 1.5 hours each.

    For the workshop, usually we would like to have longer talks but also time
    for discussion.
    So, my suggestion would be two 30-minute talks per period, with 15 minutes
    each for discussion.
    Of course, we dont need to be too strict on this. Perhaps three 20-minutes
    talks on one subject and 30 min discussion also works well.

    I will have a conversation with Paolo Giacomelli and Franco Bedeschi on
    Friday afternoon.
    In the meantime, we can collect a list of possible talks.

    Regards,
    -Joao

.. s5_talk:: 

    Opticks is an open source project that applies state-of-the-art GPU ray tracing 
    from NVIDIA OptiX to optical photon simulation and integrates this with Geant4. 
    This results in drastic speedups of more than 1500 times single threaded Geant4.

    Any simulation limited by optical photons can remove those limits by using Opticks.

    This render shows the photons resulting from a muon crossing the JUNO scintillator, 
    each line represents a single photon.

    The number of photons across track lengths up to 35m in the scintillator 
    is about 70M
