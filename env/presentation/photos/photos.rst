photos

Ideas for more 


Concerning the photos you need, from the translation of the instructions::

    1. Report filling: log in to the ARP system "International Talent Program"
    finalization acceptance page, complete the finalization report and performance
    completion status. For projects executed overseas, it is necessary to specify
    in the "Summary of Experts' Work in the Research Institute" that the execution
    method is overseas execution, and a special description of the working hours,
    work content, execution results, and overseas task supervision of overseas
    executions shall be made. At the same time, upload at least four photos of
    remote video and online office work in the attachment.

I see that the photos need to be of “remote video and online office work”.
I guess that means screenshots of zoom meetings and while making presentations ? 
Unfortunately I was unaware of the requirement to prove participation in 
meetings by taking screenshots.

However I can make screenshots now of indico pages of the events with my contributions
visible, together with dates and titles of presentations. 
As that proves the same thing, I hope that will be OK ?
