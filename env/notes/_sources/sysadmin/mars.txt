Mars
=====

7 June 2012
::

        This is just for your information. I applied a minor tweak for our mars
        cluster. Now if you login to mars, and execute "locallogin" instead of login to
        deimos1, and it will lead you to one of the deimos nodes with load balancing.  

        I have tried to unified (not fully, which is very difficult...) the installed
        packages on 6 work nodes. So in principle 6 working servers should all work in
        the same way now. If you find you cannot do some of your work on a specific
        node, please let me know.
