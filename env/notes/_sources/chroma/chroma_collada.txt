Chroma COLLADA
================

Current G4DAE material handling are just names, need:

#. implement the GDML G4 material (and surface) wavelength array 
   properties into COLLADA extra tags

#. hmm maybe GDML does not cover wavelength dependant props, will need to 
   devise xml format and handling for that

GDML: it is now possible to customise the reader as well as the writer to treat
ad-hoc user extensions to the GDML schema. The GDML writer now also supports
dumping of optical surface properties associated with surfaces and materials.
