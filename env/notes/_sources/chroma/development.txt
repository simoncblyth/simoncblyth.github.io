Chroma Development
====================

Primary Repo
--------------

* https://bitbucket.org/chroma/chroma

Forks
------

* https://bitbucket.org/mastbaum/chroma

Dev approach
--------------

* fork into my account on bitbucket, `hg clone` from there
* this allows easy sharing of fixes
* advantage : simplicity of only one local chroma repo to manage
