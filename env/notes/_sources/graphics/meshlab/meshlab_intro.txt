    MeshLab is a advanced mesh processing system, for the automatic and user
    assisted editing, cleaning, filtering converting and rendering of large
    unstructured 3D triangular meshes. MeshLab is actively developed by the a small
    group of people at the Visual Computing Lab at the ISTI - CNR institute, a
    large group of university students and some great developers from the rest of
    the world. For the basic mesh processing tasks and for the internal data
    structures the system relies on the GPL VCG library.

VCG
----

    The Visualization and Computer Graphics Library (VCG for short) is a open
    source portable C++ templated library for manipulation, processing and
    displaying with OpenGL of triangle and tetrahedral meshes.

    The library, composed by more than 100k lines of code, is released under the
    GPL license, and it is the base of most of the software tools of the Visual
    Computing Lab of the Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI
    (http://vcg.isti.cnr.it), like metro and MeshLab.



Observations
-------------

#. supports VRML/X3D/STL import and export 
#. documentation is sparse
#. billed as for handling *unstrucutured* meshes : does that mean it will flatten the scene graph ?


iOS source ? (hmm GPL)

Quote from http://sourceforge.net/p/meshlab/discussion/499533/thread/836b4da1/

    The source code of MeshLab for iOS and MeshLab for Android is not available for
    the general public. We can provide customized version of it, or license the
    viewing component under a commercial agreement.
