Tip for usage on underpowered machine
---------------------------------------

Switch to point rendering (rather than wireframe or solid) when navigating 
to where you want to be. 

Point rendering manages ~4 fps whereas the others are difficult 
to use at 0.3 fps.  Then switch to nicer rendering when in position.
