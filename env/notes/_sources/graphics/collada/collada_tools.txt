From http://www.tutorgigpedia.com/ed/COLLADA


COLLADA DOM (C++) - 
    The COLLADA DOM is generated at compile-time from the
    COLLADA schema. It provides a low-level interface that eliminates the need for
    hand-written parsing routines, but is limited to reading and writing only one
    version of COLLADA, making it difficult to upgrade as new versions are
    released.

FCollada (C++) - 
    A utility library available from Feeling Software. In contrast
    to the COLLADA DOM, Feeling Software's FCollada provides a higher-level
    interface. FCollada is used in ColladaMaya, ColladaMax, and several commercial
    game engines. The development of the open source part was discontinued by
    Feeling Software in 2008. The company continues to support its paying customers
    and licenses with improved versions of its software.

OpenCOLLADA (C++) - 
    The OpenCOLLADA project provides plugins for 3ds Max and
    Maya and the sources of utility libraries which were developed for the plugins.

pycollada (Python) - 
    A Python module for creating, editing and loading COLLADA.
    The library allows the application to load a COLLADA file and interact with it
    as a Python object. In addition, it supports creating a COLLADA Python object
    from scratch, as well as in-place editing.

Scene Kit (Objective-C) - 
    An Objective-C framework introduced in OS X 10.8
    Mountain Lion that allows reading, high-level manipulation and display of
    COLLADA scenes.

GLGE (JavaScript) - 
    a JavaScript library presenting COLLADA files in a web
    browser using WebGL.

Three.js (JavaScript) - 
    a 3D Javascript library capable of loading COLLADA
    files in a web browser.

StormEngineC (JavaScript) - 
    Javascript 3D graphics library with option of
    loading COLLADA files.
