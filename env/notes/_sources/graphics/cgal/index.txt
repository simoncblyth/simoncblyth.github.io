The goal of the CGAL Open Source Project is to provide easy access to efficient
and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library. CGAL is used in
various areas needing geometric computation, such as: computer graphics,
scientific visualization, computer aided design and modeling, geographic
information systems, molecular biology, medical imaging, robotics and motion
planning, mesh generation, numerical methods... More on the projects using CGAL
