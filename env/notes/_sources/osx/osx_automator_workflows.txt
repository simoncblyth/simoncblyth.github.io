#. Open Automator, choose *Service*, 

   * Select `Service receives: PDF files`  in `any application`
   * Drag `Library > PDFs > Combine PDF Pages` action from 2nd column into the empty 3rd column
   * Drag `Library > Files & Folders > Rename Finder Items`

     * a warning comes up, about using a copy instead of a rename. Its OK however 
       as we are dealing with a newly created PDF, so agree to the rename

     * select `Name Single Item` from the list and in `Options` tab select `Show this action when the workflow runs`

   * NB to give more space in 3rd column, close the disclosure triangles on the actions 
    
   * Drag `Library > Files & Folders > Move Finder Items` into the 3rd column
 
     * leave destination at default location of `Desktop`

#. Now `File > Save..` and enter name for the Service: `Combine PDFs` and exit from Automator.app

   * NB exiting is necessary, as without it the Service does not appear in contextual menu
     after having selected some PDFs
