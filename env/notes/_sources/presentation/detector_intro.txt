Standard Slides about Detector Design for Conferences

::


    Recently I suggested the CD and Veto group to prepare some standard slides
    about detector design for conferences and proceedings. It's recommended to use
    the pictures or numbers in those slides. We'll keep such slides being updated
    and polished. The preliminary version was uploaded into:
    http://juno.ihep.ac.cn/cgi-bin/Dev_DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=1468

    Your slide 9 seems a bit old. Could you refer to the new overall scheme slides
    in Doc1468?
