G4DAEView Architecture
========================

Division of concerns
----------------------

`DAEConfig`
        argument parsing

`DAEGeometry`
        parsing pycollada file and preparing vertex, triangle arrays ready to make VBO

`DAEScene`
        hold state and coordinate

`DAEFrameHandler`
        control of underlying glumpy Frame, presenting graphical view

`DAEInteractivityHandler`
        handle mouse/keyboard inputs and propagate desired actions 

`DAEViewpoint`
         point of view

`DAETrackball`
         rotation and projection, transient offsets from `DAEViewpoint`
