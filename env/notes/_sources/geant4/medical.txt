GATE is an advanced opensource software developed by the international OpenGATE
collaboration and dedicated to numerical simulations in medical imaging and
radiotherapy. It currently supports simulations of Emission Tomography
(Positron Emission Tomography - PET and Single Photon Emission Computed
Tomography - SPECT), Computed Tomography (CT) and Radiotherapy experiments.
Using an easy-to-learn macro mechanism to configurate simple or highly
sophisticated experimental settings, GATE now plays a key role in the design of
new medical imaging devices, in the optimization of acquisition protocols and
in the development and assessment of image reconstruction algorithms and
correction techniques. It can also be used for dose calculation in radiotherapy
experiments.
